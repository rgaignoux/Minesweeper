# How to play

- Left click on a tile to open it.
- Right click on a tile to mark it as a mine.
- Double left click to open all the tiles surrounding a tile with a number, if you have marked the number of mines around that number.

You can start a new game by pressing the « smiley » button

# To start a game

```
python3 main.py

By default, the minesweeper will be initialized by a 10x10 grid, with 10 mines. This can be changed in the main.py file.
